- 🎨 Create images with AI image generation APIs
- 📁 Automatically organize and store content in Google Drive
- 🔄 Automate the entire UGC content creation process
- 🔐 Securely manage API credentials and authentication

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting the workshop, ensure you have:

- [ ] A Google account (for Google Drive & Google AI Studio)
- [ ] An OpenAI account (for GPT API access)
- [ ] An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
